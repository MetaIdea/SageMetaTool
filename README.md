# SageMetaTool

A universal dll mod for most sage engine games that brings important engine updates and adds unique new features.

Key features (singleplayer skirmish game focused, multiplayer untested, all aspects WIP):
- Fluent 60 fps with proper gamespeed
- Unlimited camera zoom (narrow and wide)
- Dozens of new unique universal gamemodes compatible with any map + live mod/config loader, all via a completely new skirmish setup sub menu
- First and third person mode with real WASD unit control (C&C renegade vibes)
- Meta control ingame sandbox menu to change countless different options including object spawner menu, unit colorizer, AI live adjusting/scripting
- Spawner menu auto loads all game objects available even from mods in BFME2, ROTWK and Zero Hour. 
- Powerfull ingame lua script console (Useable commands: https://pastebin.com/xHHGCVZ1)
- Heavy extension of the sage lua framework, fix of player and coordinate parameters, register of every object to be accessible via lua
- Complete Lua scripting framework for C&C generals zero hour (Useable commands: https://pastebin.com/M4wZcJKv)
- CNC Online and T3A Online implemented (WIP)
- New Key remapping menu

Supported games (9/10 sage games, note: also works for all mods):

- Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour (retail 1.04 or nocd) (WIP, lacks proper gamespeed)
- Lord of the Rings The Battle for Middle-earth 1 (retail nocd) (WIP)
- Lord of the Rings The Battle for Middle-earth 2 (retail nocd)
- Lord of the Rings The Battle for Middle-earth 2 - Rise of the Witch-King (retail nocd)
- Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars (steam)
- Command and Conquer 3 Kane's Wrath (steam)
- Command and Conquer Red Alert 3 (steam)
- Command and Conquer Red Alert 3 Uprising (steam)
- Command and Conquer 4 (all versions steam/origin) (WIP)

By using advanced signature (binary pattern) scanning methods all sub versions should be supported as well in the future. There is a chance origin versions work partially or entirely too already.

Only the original Command and Conquer Generals is not yet supported in any way because I strongly believe most use zero hour anyway.

A special thanks goes to:
